/**
 * A list of all the full location names in the JHU CSSE USA data.
 *
 * The US data files are relatively large, as they contain data at the county level. For this
 * reason, the API class can be set up to lazy load the US data when the user requests the data of
 * a US location. But for the user to know that the US locations are available, we need to return
 * these location names in the location list.
 *
 * We can't fetch these names from GitHub, as that would mean downloading the whole US data, which
 * would defeat the purpose of lazy loading in the first place.
 *
 * The "not so great but working" solution is to keep these location names as a static array.
